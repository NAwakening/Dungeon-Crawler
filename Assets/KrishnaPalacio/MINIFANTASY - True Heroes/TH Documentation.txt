Demo
	The demo is meant to showcase each character's animations. 
	The Druid's forms are separated into separate models for the sake of the demo.

Scripts
	None of the scripts included in this pack are necessary to use the basic pack contents.

Game Display
	The demos were created using a 16:9 Aspect Ratio. 
	If you have issues with the game screen displaying incorrectly, try setting the display to 16:9 Aspect and the Scale to 1x.
	Also, try toggling the "Run In Edit Mode" button on the Pixel Perfect Camera component located on the Main Camera gameobject for crisp pixels in the game window while editing.
